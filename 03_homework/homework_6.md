**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

  I am a junior engineer in training and a candidate to become a professional engineer within the next few months. The code of ethics of engineers represents all the duties and obligations that govern the conduct of members of this profession such as myself. Its primary objective is the protection of the public, but it also aims to preserve the honor of the profession.
  
  All engineers must comply with a set of ethical obligations that aim to protect the public and preserve the honor and dignity of the profession. The duties and obligations can be broadly divided into four categories. They include those towards the public, those towards clients, those towards the profession, and those relative to self-promotion.
  
  Starting with an engineerâ€™s obligations towards the public, they must be conscious of the consequences of their work on people and the environment in all aspects of their work. An engineer must speak up when they deem that certain engineering work poses a danger to public safety. Also, their opinions on engineering matters should only be given based on sufficient knowledge.
  
  Moving on to the duties towards clients, an engineer must carry out their professional work with integrity and with no false representation of their level of competence. An engineer must also exhibit reasonable availability and diligence in their professional practice. Another important aspect is the proper use of their seal and signature which is governed by specific regulations. An engineer should also remain professionally independent and impartial while avoiding conflicts of interest. In addition, the secrecy of confidential information should always be respected.
  
  As for their obligations towards the engineering profession, an engineer must refrain from acts that are derogatory to the dignity of the profession. Also, they must maintain a professional relation with the order of which they are a member as well as their colleagues. In addition, an engineer must contribute to the advancement and development of the profession by sharing their knowledge and experience with colleagues or students. Finally, with regards to obligations relative to self-promotion, they must not make false claims about their services such as misleading the public about their experience or qualifications.
